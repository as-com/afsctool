# afsctool
AFSC (Apple File System Compression) tool for Mac OS Sierra or above

This is a clone of afsctool 1.6.4 (build 34) and consecutive patches are applied to adapt to newer release of Mac OS like Sierra.

AFSC (Apple File System Compression) tool is an utility that can be used to apply HFS+ compression to file(s), decompress HFS+ compressed file(s), or get information about existing HFS+ compressed file(s).

A major problem which causes "Unable to compress file" error is now fixed due to different file type returned by Mac OS since Sierra.

Mac OS 10.12 or later is required.
